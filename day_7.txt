1. What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?
ans- Statically typed: if the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself then such             types of
programming languages are called as “Statically typed”.

Eg: C,C++,Java


Dynamically typed: if the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself then such types of
programming languages are called as “dynamically typed”.

Eg: Python,PHP,JavaScript

6. List the Operators in Java?
ans-Operators in Java can be classified into 6 typesD
  a.Arithmetic OperatorP
  b. Relational OperatorP
  c.Logical OperatorP
  d.Assignment OperatorP
  e.Unary OperatorP
  f.Bitwise Operators
7. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples.
ans-
  increment operator increase the value by 1
  decrement operator decrease the value by 1

 int a=3;
 int b=7;
 a++;
 b--;
new value is
a=4
b=6
