1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
ans - if
      if else
      nested if else
      switch case statement
2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
ans -a.unary operator
     b.binary operator
     c.ternary operator
3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
ans - we want to do multiple operations on it based upon what value it is storing. In
such cases the switch statement comes into play.

It is like an if-else ladder with multiple conditions, where we check for equality of a variable with various values 

4. What are the priority levels  of arithmetic operation in Java?
ans -*,/,% have 1  priority
     +,-  have 2 priority

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
ans -They are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression. For instance, if we want to print
a number only if it is greater than 2 and less than 5, then we will use conditional operators to combine the 2
expressions. We have 3 types of conditional operators - logical-and, logical-or and ternary operator.


6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
ans -if (condition) {

statement - 1

} 
else 
{
statement - 2

}
7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
ans- 1.while
      2. for
       3. do while
8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
ans -Sd Use a for loop when you are traversing a data structure like an arrayd
)d Use a for loop when you know that loop needs to run ‘n’ number of times.

Whereas,I
Sd Use a while loop when increment type is nonstandard like i = i * 2d
)d Use a while loop when you are unsure till when the loop will continue, like while finding the first number divisible by

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10
ans - public class print1to10 {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
            System.out.println(i);
    }
}
